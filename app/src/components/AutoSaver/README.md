The AutoSaver component is used to track changes to state and handle automatic saving to localStorage/API.

Plans:
- Component can be used to save changes periodically rather than immediately, reducing the number of API calls
- Component can display messages to the user pertaining to saving
- Component can render a button, allowing the user to save on command
- Component can prevent closing the window and notify the user of unsaved changes
